I ask myself this question every day.

People have described me as:  Art director, designer, caring, leader, artist, quick-learner, rule-breaker (mostly by my parents), and live-wire.

I recently moved to Vancouver, BC from Chapel Hill, North Carolina and am currently looking for a job that will challenge me and increase the scope of my creativity.

If you have any Vancouver-related trivia that you have been dying to share with someone or career-related ideas/suggestions/opportunities, please email them to vennelasmedapati@gmail.com or call me at +1 919-758-0737.

I love learning new things and I cannot wait to learn from you!

Vennela Medapati
