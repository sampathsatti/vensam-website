![This is me][1]

My name is Sampath Satti and I started wheel throwing in 2018. I haven't been able to stop since :) I primarily make functional pottery. Vases, bowls, plates, plant pots and the like. I primarily focus on the form-function fit. Most of my pottery is intended for a specific use-case and solves a problem that I've either personally encountered or has been shared with me.

#### Past

I started off learning ceramics and primarily wheel-throwing at the UBC pottery club from lovely humans and teachers (Angelique, Carmen and Sam, thanks a TON!). I have since graduated from the university but I am currently a community member of the studio. During this time, I also sold some of my ceramics at the UBC farm markets and pet many dogs as part of the UBC pottery collective/coop. I challenged myself to throw the large things, repeatable things and also with blindfolds. I did stay away from handbuilding as well as altering shapes in my desire for radial symmetry and "perfection".

#### Present

I am currently at a crossroads at my pottery journey. I am heavily influenced by reading material on casting for my day job, which I am excited to bring to pottery in the form of plaster slip casting. I am also looking to build up a small-ish home studio/desk where I'm able to do wheelthrowing of simple forms, spend time handbuilding and collaborate with loved ones. Working within the constraints of a home studio without plumbing, or a 10 sqft space should help me come up with a few process improvements, and hopefully some innovation!

#### Future

I'm always looking to share my learnings with a larger set of people. It is unlikely that I will ever be a production potter, I simply do not have the tolerance for such pain after graduate school. However, the act of making tangible things with my hands is something that I quite enjoy and hope that I can help engender similar emotions and feelings in others too.

#### Influences

Hans Coper, Lucy Rie, Florian Gadsby, Adam Frew and Janaki Larsen.
